# Release Plan Status Evaluation

_Last updated: 2025-10-01_

## Current Stage Summary
- **Stage**: Milestone M1 ‚Äì Code Scaffold (in progress).
- **Rationale**: Unity project settings, scoped assembly definitions, deterministic services, and tick management with EditMode tests are now implemented. Baseline data containers and integration seams remain outstanding before calling M1 complete.

## Milestone Breakdown

| Milestone | Deliverable Snapshot | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **M0 ‚Äì Docs & Scaffolding** | Documentation set (design, architecture, tests), project scaffolding, Unity-focused `.gitignore`, placeholder assets | ‚úÖ Complete | `docs/` design docs, refreshed `README.md`, Unity folder layout in `Assets/` and `ProjectSettings/` |
| **M1 ‚Äì Code Scaffold** | Unity project settings, assembly definitions, deterministic services, TickManager, baseline data containers with tests | üü° In progress | `ProjectSettings/*.asset`, asmdefs in `Assets/_Project/Scripts/**`, deterministic services & tick manager (`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Core/**`), EditMode tests in `Tests/EditMode/*.cs`; data containers still pending |
| **M2 ‚Äì Overworld Gen + Sim** | World generation pipeline, overworld simulation loop, legends logging, persistence seams with tests | ‚è≥ Not started | No overworld generation or simulation implementations present |
| **M3 ‚Äì Base Mode MVP** | Base scene systems (zones, jobs, raids, social mandates), Oracle integration, comprehensive save/load & tests | ‚è≥ Not started | Base mode gameplay systems not yet implemented |

## Key Gating Items to Finish M1
1. Add baseline data containers and serialization seams referenced in `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`.
2. Wire deterministic services into bootstrapping flows (e.g., scriptable installers) to demonstrate integration across scenes.
3. Expand EditMode coverage to include data container validation and lifecycle tests per `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`.

## Recommended Next Steps
- Finalize outstanding data containers to close M1 scope before committing to simulation work.
- Introduce CI/test automation to execute the existing EditMode suite and guard the deterministic core.
- Begin drafting overworld generation prototypes (per `docs/WORLDGEN.md`) once M1 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied.
