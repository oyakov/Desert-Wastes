# Release Plan Status Evaluation

_Last updated: 2025-10-01_

## Current Stage Summary
- **Stage**: Milestone M0 – Docs & Scaffolding.
- **Rationale**: Repository currently contains documentation, planning artifacts, and placeholder Unity folders without runtime code or assets.

## Milestone Breakdown

| Milestone | Deliverable Snapshot | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **M0 – Docs & Scaffolding** | Documentation set (design, architecture, tests), project scaffolding, Unity-focused `.gitignore`, placeholder assets | ✅ Complete | `docs/` design docs, `README.md` summary of current repository contents, `.gitignore`, placeholder folders in `Assets/` and `ProjectSettings/` |
| **M1 – Code Scaffold** | Unity project settings, assembly definitions, deterministic services, TickManager, baseline data containers with tests | ⏳ Not started | `ProjectSettings/` contains only `placeholder.txt`; no `*.asmdef` or `Scripts/` content yet |
| **M2 – Overworld Gen + Sim** | World generation pipeline, overworld simulation loop, legends logging, persistence seams with tests | ⏳ Not started | No gameplay code or simulation assets present |
| **M3 – Base Mode MVP** | Base scene systems (zones, jobs, raids, social mandates), Oracle integration, comprehensive save/load & tests | ⏳ Not started | No gameplay implementation or scenes beyond scaffolding |

## Key Gating Items to Reach M1
1. Generate Unity project settings files and assembly definition assets per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Implement deterministic service interfaces (RNG, time) and foundational managers outlined in `docs/TEST_PLAN.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Establish initial EditMode unit tests covering the scaffolding components.

## Recommended Next Steps
- Spin up Unity 2022/2023 LTS project to replace placeholder settings.
- Create core script assemblies and stub interfaces to enable deterministic systems.
- Prioritize automation setup (CI/test harness) aligned with `docs/TEST_PLAN.md` before expanding into M2 features.
